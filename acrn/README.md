ACRN = Acoustic Coordinated Reset Neuromodulation
====

This is an implementation of the Acoustic Coordinated Reset Neuromodulation tinnitus treatment protocol in javascript.
I'm currently hosting it on my [website](http://www.generalfuzz.net/acrn/).

Feel free to fix any bugs you find or add features.

[Paper it is based on](http://www.thetinnitusclinic.co.uk/downloads/Tass%20et%20al_RNN%202012_Counteracting%20Tinnitus%20by%20Acoustic%20CR%20Neuromodulation.pdf)
